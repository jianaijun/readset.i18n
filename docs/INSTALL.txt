readset.i18n Installation
-------------------------

To install readset.i18n into the global Python environment (or a workingenv),
using a traditional Zope 2 instance, you can do this:

* When you're reading this you have probably already run 
  ``easy_install readset.i18n``. Find out how to install setuptools
  (and EasyInstall) here:
  http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall

* Create a file called ``readset.i18n-configure.zcml`` in the
  ``/path/to/instance/etc/package-includes`` directory.  The file
  should only contain this::

    <include package="readset.i18n" />


To install readset.i18n using zc.buildout and the plone.recipe.zope2instance
recipe to manage your project, you can do this:

* Add ``readset.i18n`` to the list of eggs to install, e.g.:

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        ...
        readset.i18n
       
* Re-run buildout, e.g. with:

    $ ./bin/buildout
